# JBurst

### What is it?
JBurst is a non-revolutionary addition to the Java Swing package that adds sprites with animation and simple transformation methods.

### Why did I make it?
My computer science teacher always encouraged my classmates and I to work on personal projects in class during our free time.
One day, when he found me playing web games, he told me I should make my own game. 
I searched for Java engines that a school computer would allow and in the end came up with nothing.
So, I decided I'd make my own.

### Does it work?
It does! For the most part.
I work on this in my free time during class so it may have problems here and there.
If you find one, report it! I'll look into it.

## How do I use it?
The template folder provides an example program using JBurst, and a Swing tutorial can be at
[Java Swing Tutorial](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/).\
*Note:* I compile this using `JDK 18.0.1`, but I'm doing my best to make sure older versions can use it as well.
If I missed something, mention it.

## Helping
I am a novice programmer. I know a lot of this could be improved, and I've accepted that.
I am of course hoping to improve it, but there are things that I do not know.
So, if you have any advice or suggestions that may help me further my knowledge of Java or even just programming in general,
I would *love* to hear them!

If you enjoy using this, give HaxeFlixel a shot.
The base of this engine is modeled on theirs, so they're very similar on a basic level.
It uses an awesome language known as [Haxe](https://haxe.org/) and is *completely* open-source.\
Plus, Flixel is an *actual* engine, so you can use it to compile *actual* games.
