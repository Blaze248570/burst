# Burst

## What is it?
JBurst is a nonrevolutionary addition to JavaSwing that makes adding images just *slightly* easier.\
It also makes animation much simpler. (Simpler for me at least.)

## Why did I make it?
Because I have way too much free time in class and all the game engines won't work on the school computers.\
So I made my own! (Sort of)

## Does it work?
It does! For the most part.\
Do keep in mind I worked on this in my free time during class so it may crash in a few places.\
If it does, report it! I'll look into it.

## How do I use it?
The template folder provides an example program using JBurst.

If you enjoy using this, give HaxeFlixel a shot.\
They're very similar on a basic level, but you'll find Flixel can get very interesting very fast.\
And a lot of the concepts employed in the animation system mirrors theirs, so it feels wrong not to direct people to them.\
Plus, Flixel is an *actual* engine, so you can use it to compile *actual* games.
