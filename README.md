# JBurst

### What is it?
JBurst is a nonrevolutionary addition to the Java Swing package that makes adds animation.

### Why did I make it?
I could never find a good animation method that didn't require me to visit seven sketchy websites.
So I made my own!\
(Also because I have way too much free time in class.)

### Does it work?
It does! For the most part.
Do keep in mind I worked on this in my free time during class so it have a few problems here and there.
If you find one, report it! I'll look into it.

### How do I use it?
The template folder provides an example program using JBurst.

## Helping
I am a novice programmer. I know a lot of this could be improved, and I've accepted that.
I am of course hoping to improve it, but there are things that I do not know.
So, if you have any advice or suggestions that may help me further my knowledge of programming or even just Java in general,
I would *love* to hear them!

If you enjoy using this, give HaxeFlixel a shot.
They're very similar on a basic level, but you'll find Flixel can get very interesting very fast,
and a lot of the concepts employed in the animation system mirrors its, so it feels wrong not to direct people to it.
Plus, Flixel is an *actual* engine, so you can use it to compile *actual* games.
