# Things to Add or Improve

- **Better Documentation**

    The concepts I've learned from
    Flixel regarding animation properties have become invaluable to me,
    So I'd like to be able to share them with others.

- **Implement other animation file parsing methods.**

    Maybe seperate images with a common file name
    EX. walk0000.png, walk0001.png, walk0002.png...
    
- **Properly employ camera system**

    The JBurstCamera has more or less just been a painting manager.
