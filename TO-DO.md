# JBurst To-do List

## Urgent

- Ensure the burstThread is safe and won't lead to future problems. (Ideally remove completely)

## Things to Reformat

- JBurstGame - I'd like this to be a "thing" as opposed to being the window itself.

- JBurstCamera - The camera system hasn't really done much so far, and it has a lot of potential.

- JBurstGraphic - I need to better myself with understanding how Swing/Java uses graphics to make this class as efficient as possible.

## To Be Improved

- Documentation - The concepts and code-flows I've learned from studying Flixel are invaluable to me, so I'd like to be able to properly convey them with others.
