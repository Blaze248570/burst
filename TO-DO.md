# Things to Add or Improve

- **Better Documentation**\
    I sorta got lazy and the concepts I've learned from
    Flixel regarding animation properties have become invaluable to me.

- **Implement other animation file parsing methods.**\
    Maybe seperate images with a common file name
    EX. walk0000.png, walk0001.png, walk0002.png...

- **Get rid of the necessity of a `while(true)` loop.**\
    It's embarrassing...
