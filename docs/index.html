                    A library made for <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/" target="_blank">Java Swing</a>
                    modeled from <a href="https://haxeflixel.com" target="_blank">HaxeFlixel</a> that adds sprites with animation and simple transformation methods.
                    <br/><br/>
                    I always found it frustrating how JLabel only really supported static images.
                    <br/>
                    (This was once intended to be a very basic game engine, like HaxeFlixel, but there wasn't really much purpose in copying them)

                <div class="aligned-container">
                    <img class="preview-image" alt="pichu-spritesheet" src="./spritesheet-preview.gif"/>

                        The main thing this library does is add animated images.
                        <br/><br/>
                        This is accomplished through the use of spritesheets and frame atlases. 
                        <br/>
                        Supported spritesheet formats include ones with even spacing (can be cut into regions of identical size),
                        sparrow texture atlases, and json exture-packer atlases.
                    </p>

                <div class="aligned-container">
                    <img class="preview-image" src="./transformation-preview.gif" alt="gallery-preview"/>

                        On top of animation, it also makes transformations such as rotation and dilation (growth) much, much simpler.
                        <br/>
                        When transforming graphics, offsets are automatically calculated and applied to the sprite to keep it in the position its intended to be in.
